# Discrete Math HW5

Firstly, you should download any compiler (e.g. Clang, GCC, ...)  
To compile the code, use "clang++ {$filename}" or "g++ {$filename}" or etc.  
Then run the built .exe file in the console using "./{$filename}"  
**You might wanna use CMake to build .exe files from .cpp. In this case check CMakeLists.txt as well.**

> You can also use online compilers to run code, but they might be slow.  
> _Time Limit Exceptions_ might pop up as well.

Solutions are located in "src" folder.
File "full_code.cpp" contains all the solutions that were written.
