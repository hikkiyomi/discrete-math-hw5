# Discrete Math HW5

> Firstly, you should download any compiler (e.g. Clang, GCC, ...)  
> To compile the code, use "clang++ $filename" or "g++ $filename" or etc.  
> Then run the exe file in the console using "./filename"  
> **You might wanna use CMake to build .exe files from .cpp. In this case check CMakeLists.txt firstly.**

> You can also use online compilers to run code, but they might be slow.  
> _Time Limit Exceptions_ might pop up as well.

> File "full_code.cpp" contains all the solutions that were written.
